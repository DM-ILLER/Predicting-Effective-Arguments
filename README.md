# Predicting-Effective-Arguments

The dataset presented here contains argumentative essays written by U.S students in grades 6-12. These essays were annotated by expert raters for discourse elements commonly found in argumentative writing:

Lead - an introduction that begins with a statistic, a quotation, a description, or some other device to grab the reader’s attention and point toward the thesis

Position - an opinion or conclusion on the main question 

Claim - a claim that supports the position

Counterclaim - a claim that refutes another claim or gives an opposing reason to the position

Rebuttal - a claim that refutes a counterclaim

Evidence - ideas or examples that support claims, counterclaims, or rebuttals.

Concluding Statement - a concluding statement that restates the claims

My task is to predict the quality rating of each discourse element. Human readers rated each rhetorical or argumentative element, in order of increasing quality, as one of:

1.) Ineffective

2.) Adequate

3.) Effective
